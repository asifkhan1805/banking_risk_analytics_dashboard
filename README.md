# üè¶ Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard

Welcome to the **Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard** project! 
This project demonstrates how modern risk analytics and interactive business intelligence dashboards can help financial institutions minimize lending risks, make informed decisions, and visualize key banking metrics.

## üìä Project Overview

Banks and financial institutions face significant risks when granting loans. 
Leveraging data analytics and visualization can transform raw data into actionable insights‚Äîhelping lenders reduce defaults and optimize their strategies. 

In this project:
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** was performed using Python to uncover hidden patterns in client financial behavior.
- **Interactive dashboards** were built with Power BI, providing an at-a-glance view of crucial metrics and client segmentation.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Model

![Data_Model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9527ffa8-9cf4-4404-a776-cf0ceea89f71)


- Shows relationships between fact and dimension tables for integrity and flexibility.

**Key tables include:**  
- `Clients-Banking`(Facts_Table)
- `Banking Relationship`(Dimension_Table)
- `Investment Advisor`(Dimension_Table)
- `Gender`(Dimension_Table)
- `Period`(Dimension_Table)

## üßπ Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

- **Calculated engagement timeframe and engagement days** per client.
- **Created income bands** to segment clients as Low, Mid, High.
- **Processing fees** estimated based on fee structure.
- **Binned and calculated KPIs** for streamlined analysis.

---

## ‚ö° EDA Insights (Python)

- **Strong positive correlations** among `Bank Deposits`, `Checking Accounts`, `Savings`, and `Foreign Currency Accounts` ‚Äî Customers with high balances in one account often hold more in others.
- **Savings and Deposits** are closely linked, reflecting similar behavior.
- **Income & Age** positively relate to higher account balances, savings, and loans.
- **Property ownership** less correlated‚Äîmay depend on external factors.
- **Business lending** forms a distinct banking segment, only moderately connected to personal borrowing.
